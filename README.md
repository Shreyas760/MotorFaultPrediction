# ðŸ”§ Motor Fault Prediction System

A real-time *predictive maintenance system* that uses machine learning to detect and classify faults in industrial motors. This web-based platform helps industries reduce downtime, optimize maintenance, and improve motor lifespan with 92.7% accuracy.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

Electric motors are the backbone of many industries, and their unexpected failure leads to high costs and downtime. This project uses a *hybrid model* combining *machine learning (Random Forest)* and *deterministic fault classification formulas* to predict and categorize motor faults in real-time.

The project features a *Flask backend* and a *responsive HTML/CSS frontend* where users can input motor parameters and instantly receive fault predictions and actionable insights.
